{"id":"pit-ifo","title":"Harden backend identity and cache behavior for id-less backends","description":"## Context\nWhile implementing `todo-md`, we identified core backend contract nuances that can cause subtle bugs in `pi-tasks`, especially for backends without stable persisted IDs.\n\n## Problem\n`pi-tasks` now supports internal refs and optional user-facing IDs, but there are still cross-backend risks around:\n- identity stability (refs can change after re-parse/reload for id-less sources)\n- stale in-memory caches (backend may not detect external file changes)\n- edit/data-fetch assumptions (list vs show freshness, missing fields)\n\nThese risks are not unique to `todo-md`; other file-based or generated-identity backends can hit similar issues.\n\n## Observed Nuances / Risks\n1. **Ref stability across sessions**\n   - If refs are synthesized from content/position, title/description edits or reorderings can change refs after reload.\n   - Potential effect: selection/edit targets may not be stable across restarts.\n\n2. **Cache invalidation**\n   - In-memory document caches improve responsiveness but can hide external edits.\n   - Reopening task list in the same process may still show stale data.\n\n3. **Freshness contract between list/show/update**\n   - Current flows sometimes assume list items are complete enough and only call show when fields are missing.\n   - Backend-specific omission behavior (e.g. empty fields omitted) can cause unnecessary refetches or stale assumptions.\n\n4. **Closed/archive visibility UX coupling**\n   - Backend may move closed tasks to archive while UI only shows active tasks.\n   - Easy to lose visibility after status toggles if list behavior is not explicit.\n\n## Why this matters\nWithout explicit contract rules and regression tests, we risk backend-specific edge cases, surprising task disappearance/staleness, and brittle future adapter work.\n\n## Proposed Outcomes\n- Define and document backend identity contract (what must be stable, and when).\n- Define cache strategy contract (when to refresh, when to trust cache, invalidation triggers).\n- Define list/show/update freshness expectations and fallback behavior.\n- Add regression coverage for id-less backends and stale-cache scenarios.\n- Align UX behavior for closed/archive flows across backends.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- Contract doc/checklist exists for adapter authors (identity + cache + freshness).\n- At least one regression test (or deterministic harness) covers id-less backend edit/reload behavior.\n- At least one regression test covers external file change + refresh behavior.\n- Clear decision captured for closed/archive visibility UX in active list.","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"dev@soleone.xyz","created_at":"2026-02-08T23:12:03.281914346-05:00","created_by":"Soleone","updated_at":"2026-02-08T23:12:03.281914346-05:00"}
